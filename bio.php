<strong>From Beto Paredes:</strong><br>

“I come from a very hardworking entrepreneurial background. When my father was 
in his late twenties he decided to move from his home of Chile to come to the 
United States. From that point on, every day spent here was a learning 
experience and opportunity to progress and succeed. Through dedication and hard 
work my father learned English and opened up an electronic technician service. 
His business flourished, as did his career, and he was eventually able to open 
up multiple locations as well as his own school for electronics. Very early on 
my brothers and I incorporated the tech industry into our lives as well, which 
was really a natural evolution from our father’s technical line of work.”<br><br>

I am also a father and have an amazing son and three lovely daughters. Respectively they are Gabriel, Scarlet, Marisol and Amelia. I love them all dearly and they are a daily inspiration for everything I do.”
