<h3>Please allow me to introduce myself. :)</h3>
<p><img src="images/pic2.jpg" alt="" align="left" style="border:1px solid #cbcbcb; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;" /><span style="color:#e80021;">As an entrepreneur,</span> I currently work closely with several partners, investors, client companies and the trusted staff of my own businesses.  With seasoned experience as an executive working in the online industry I have developed several successful entities as well as highly effective executive teams. Helping determined entrepreneurs and executives grow is my absolute passion.  There is nothing I love more than watching others succeed and grow. <br /><br />

As a founding partner and joint venture contributor I have held titles ranging from Chief Technical Officer to Chief Executive Officer in several companies. When with ApogeeInvent, I helped 6 of the INC. 500 build up their companies including MediaTrust which was the fastest growing company in New York City in 2009. Many of the projects that I work with develop into very equitable profit centers and I look forward to new ventures and possibilities.  I personally thrive in the most challenging places as a team builder and business developer.<br /><br />

I come from a very hardworking entrepreneurial background. When my father was in his late twenties he decided to move from his home of Chile to come to the United States. Every day spent here from that point on was a learning experience and opportunity to progress and succeed. Through dedication and hard work he learned English and opened up an electronic technician service. His business flourished as did his career and eventually he was able to open up multiple locations as well as his own school for electronics. Very early on my brothers and I incorporated the tech industry into our lives as well which was really a natural evolutions from our fathers direction. My brothers are now working for Apogee Invent. <br /><br /> 

I am also a father and have an amazing son and three lovely daughters. Respectively they are Gabriel, Scarlet, Marisol and Amelia.  I love them all dearly and they are a daily inspiration for everything I do.
