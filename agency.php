    This is a unique to opportunity we offer that is unlike anything other agencies offer. We have the knowledge and capability to create distributors from your current customers. A distributor is a customer that has become a gateway to more customers as they share the brand and encourage others to buy. We believe that turning customers into distributors is a viable opportunity for profit that has long been overlooked.<br />
<br />


You already have a vast amount of valuable information about the buyer already. We help you to monetize this by using the distributors to make sales rather than affiliates with high commissions. Over time, you can fully expect distributor sales to far outnumber the sales being made by affiliates. Not only will distributors bring more sales over time, but they will become a longer term customer and, because they have a vested interest in making sales, they easily increase sales by over 200%. Although distributor development is a viable and profitable advance in development, there is a lot that goes into it. That’s where we come in. Our team handles all of the technology development, branding, communications, and content requirements needed to turn your customers into distributors. We can build your brand beyond your greatest expectations.</td>

Acquiring a customer is a necessary expense that must be monetized in the most effective way possible. The more opportunities the customers have to engage in the brand, the higher the retention rates. We develop offers and customer programs that will boost customer engagement and effectively upsell products and services. Customer incentive programs come in many forms – we are here to engage customers and increase loyalty.
<br />
<br />

The most effective way to forge that connection is by providing and emphasizing experiences as a means of engaging customers and solidifying their loyalty to the brand over the long haul. We go beyond the transaction to find the emotional hook with your customers. Customers want to be recognized and rewarded for their loyalty. We find the most cost-effective and powerful ways to do this. We are positioned and communicate in a way that aligns with your brand and positioning to maximize effectiveness. Ultimately, the most important part of an incentive program is doing the math and making sure that you come out ahead. In the whole, we engage the brand continuously as part of the way to maintaining a healthy customer base extending the lifetime of their re-bills.

Growth comes with knowing your customer. Today's customers are more than consumers. They want a role in helping to both create and champion the entire customer experience. For them, everything about your company is a source of that experience—not just the product or service they're buying at the moment. They embrace transparency, are digitally plugged into powerful social networks, and have come to expect unique, high-touch experiences that keep pace with their constantly evolving needs. 
<br />
<br />

We know how to tap into a larger customer base by using your greatest resource – your current customers. We connect with your current customers and engage them at a deeper level to successfully monetize your customer base to attract more paying customers through social and viral opportunities. The recent success of social media online has become extremely competitive with any other type of online marketing. The ability for customers to engage in and share information in the social environment creates a tremendous opportunity for you to capitalize. By engaging the customer at the point of purchase with the social portal, you now have a customer that will share the product to their audience which can lead to a large amount of natural social engagement and additional non-commission sales.
