    Our mass email services allow you to create marketing materials that you can send directly to your contacts. Often these materials can be enhanced with product or website links, providing great chances for transactional marketing. Plus, ads and newsletters sent through email marketing services are incredibly easy for your contacts to share with others because of our built-in Share buttons. These elements also help build your social media following.

    We are an effective email marketing company, we know this industry and we offer the professional features you will need to create customer surveys, newsletters, and other event emails. With most products, you can even choose whether you want to create an email message from scratch or choose from a large list of creative templates.

    With a direct mailer, you can physically hold the copy in your hand before you send it out to your customers. However, if there is a mistake, it's back to the printers. An email marketing agency enables you to preview your email on your computer screen or as a printed copy from your office printer. Some email marketing services even have a preview of many of the most common displays so you can anticipate how your customers will see your marketing pieces. These handy features allow you to quickly adjust text, images or links in your email to make them accurate and attractive.

        <h4>Email Campaign Creation</h4>
      <p>
        Creating an email marketing campaign should be easy, professional, and, most of all, effective. Our services include a wizard as your email, newsletter, or survey is created to test the effectiveness of the message's wording and images. This also ensures that email providers won't mark it as spam and that your subscribers won't find it in their junk mailboxes. Our direct email marketing services also links to popular social networking sites to maximize the reach of your email campaign.

        <h4>Campaign Reporting</h4>
        <p>
        Another benefit to our bulk email marketing is specific reporting on how successful a campaign is. You'll get customized reports about which marketing tools are working and what needs to be improved. You can even use a mass email service to test customer retention and loyalty by sending special discounts to repeat customers.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Email marketing services provide reports, graphs, and statistics that show you how your email campaign is doing. You can see how many customers open your emails and even which links they click on. You can see how many people unsubscribe and how many forward your emails on to others. These reports also let you know how many emails bounced or didn't reach their intended destination, and you can tell how many are still unopened. We work with specialized analytics software to give you even more data to contribute to a successful campaign. We also help you maintain your list of contacts by automatically deleting email addresses that bounce.
